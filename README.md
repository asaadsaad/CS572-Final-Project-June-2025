### CS572 Final Project - June 2025 - Application specifications and requirements
It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Take your time to plan your project idea, write down a short description for it, set your goals, and have a clear scope. Your project must use the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.
* Must use AI features integrated with the application (Function Calling, Agents, RAG.. etc)
* All frontend add/update/delete actions or routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* All backend add/update/delete routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* Lazy-load the frontend routes, and follow a standard REST design in the backend.
* Both frontend and backend code must be safely typed, your code must be free of `any` type, whether in explicit or inferred implicit `any` type.
* Your frontend code must follow the latest Angular API V20 specification, you are not allowed to use old practices.
* Application global state and local state must be declared with signals. Derived states must use computed signals.
* Projects must have proper UI that complies with the web standards (use Angular Material or similar UI Kit).
  
Note: Chat and product listing applications are not allowed.  
  
### Notes
* **Project Initiation:** On the first day, prepare a detailed project description, UI screen sketches, and a MongoDB schema design. Contact me to review and approve the database design and project scope before starting to code.
* **Classroom Attendance:** Physical attendance in the classroom is not required during the project.
* **Instructor Availability:** I am available for support via Teams during regular class hours (10:00 AM–12:30 PM and 2:00 PM–3:00 PM, Monday through Saturday). No support is available on Sundays.
* **Student Availability:** You must be reachable via Teams during class hours for periodic check-ins. Failure to respond to Teams calls or messages within 15 minutes may impact your final grade.
* **Code Submission:** Submit a daily code push by the end of each day to demonstrate progress. Each push must include commits organized by feature. Missing pushes or inadequate commits may affect your final grade.
      
### Technical Evaluation
Please submit your final project push by 9:00 PM on Tuesday. Prepare a screen-recorded demo that introduces the project concept and demonstrates system usage. Share the video URL via Teams. Do not include or discuss code patterns, as code evaluations will be conducted separately.
  
Good luck and happy coding!
  
### Code Honor Submission Policy
All submitted code must be original. Submitting code from another source as your own, including copied patterns or snippets, constitutes plagiarism and will impact your grade. Using AI code assistance tools or generative AI for coding is prohibited for this project. Failure to explain your code during the technical evaluation will result in a No Credit (NC) grade and an academic misconduct warning for plagiarism. The only permitted AI use is for writing prompts or integrating AI APIs to add smart features to your application. Refer to the syllabus for complete course policies.
